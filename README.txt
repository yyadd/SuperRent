These are the deliverables from team 4. All the documents, executables, 
and code are included in the SuperRent folder.

documents: ./SuperRent/doc/ 
           1. The presentation is in superrent_presentation.pdf
           2. The ER diagrams are included in the Project_Report.pdf
           3. The SQL files are in two folders: sql_created_manually and 
              sql_exported_from_mysqlworkbench. The first folder includes
              the sql files that we used to set up the database initially, 
              so it doesn't contain the latest data. The second folder includes
              the sql files exported from mysqlworkbench, which can be used
              to create the database with all the current data.
